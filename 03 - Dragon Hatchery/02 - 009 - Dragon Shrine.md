# 9. Dragon Shrine

This cave is a shrine to Tiamat, but with an emphasis on her black dragon head and on black dragons in general. It also contains many Cult of the Dragon icons, and a devious trap for the unwary; see "Acid Trap" below. Flickering oil lamps provide dim light.

==[[NPC.Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|NPC - Langdedrosa Cyanwrath]]== occupies the shrine, and he is joined by two human [berserkers](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#berserker_mm). (If the adventuring party contains more than four characters, add one more berserker for each additional character. If Langdedrosa was killed, then replace him with another half-dragon with the same statistics.) If Cyanwrath fought any of the characters one-on-one in Greenest, he immediately singles out that person to address as follows.

```ad-readout
"You survived! I don't know whether to be disappointed or pleased. It's a mix of both, I think."
```

If the character beat the odds in Greenest and won the fight, you can paraphrase to reflect that. As soon as he finishes speaking, he attacks. As long as none of the characters intervene, Cyanwrath's group knows better than to interfere in his one-on-one matches. If the characters gang up on Cyanwrath or one of his guards, or try to leave the chamber, the guards attack.

If none of the characters fought Cyanwrath during the raid but spent time in the cultists' camp, read this.

```ad-readout
"You look familiar... I've seen you around the camp. If you came looking for trouble, I am the trouble you seek."
```

Then he attacks, and his guards join in immediately.

The creatures in [area 10](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,10.%20dragon%20hatchery,0) are not drawn to this fight. They hide and wait to see who wins. When the fight is over, characters have time to investigate the room.

```ad-readout
This chamber has been enlarged and reshaped from its original form. The floor and three of the walls are smooth, and stalactites and stalagmites have been polished into gleaming columns. Every surface glistens with moisture, and the air is warm and humid. The flat walls of the chamber are decorated with shallow abstract carvings of dragons. Dragons' tails coil into intricate patterns and knots that flow across the walls. The creature portrayed in the northwest corner stands out: a five-headed dragon, rising from an erupting volcano. Other dragons, which seem dwarfed by the five-headed monstrosity, flock to its side. A small, wooden chest with silver and mother-of-pearl inlays sits on the floor in the corner, in front of the monstrous dragon carving.
```
```ad-dmnote
The five-headed dragon is Tiamat, and the volcano is the Well of Dragons, where the Cult of the Dragon intends to bring Tiamat into the world. The Well of Dragons is located at the northern extreme of the Sunset Mountains. Most characters should recognize Tiamat from folktales and know she was banished to the Nine Hells long ago and remains imprisoned there. There is no way to tell from the carvings where the volcano is located, or to know if it's meant to be a prediction of events to come or just a birth metaphor for the queen of evil dragons.
The chest is locked and trapped; see "Acid Trap" below for details. Characters can open it with the key from [area 11](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,11.%20frulam%20mondath's%20chamber,0), or the lock can be picked with [thieves' tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#thieves'%20tools_phb) and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Unless the Dexterity roll is 15 or higher, however, it sets off the trap when the chest opens.

If characters spend 10 minutes or more studying the carvings, they can learn two things. 
- First, black dragons are overrepresented. Almost half the dragons shown appear to be black dragons. [[NPC.Rezmir|Wyrmspeaker Rezmir]] favors them over all other types. 
- Second, a detailed search coupled with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spots that many of the black dragon carvings have holes in their mouths.

A passage in the southwest corner of the shrine chamber leads to a chute that rises 30 feet up to [area 11](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,11.%20frulam%20mondath's%20chamber,0). A rope ladder is fixed at the top; a rug covers the opening.
```

#### Acid Trap

The holes in the dragons' mouths are nozzles for a trap that sprays acidic mist. The trap has two triggers. The first is under the chest in the northwest corner. If the chest is moved, the trap goes off. The second is in the chest. If it is forced open, or if the lock is inexpertly picked (a Dexterity result of 14 or less), the trap goes off.

[–]

```ad-readout
You hear a snap from beneath the chest, followed by a hissing sound like dozens of angry snakes—or like liquid moving through open tubes. A moment later, liquid sprays out from dozens of tiny holes in the walls and ceiling. Wherever it splashes onto the floor, the moisture on the stone bubbles and smokes. Within moments, the chamber is filled with acidic mist.
```
Everyone in the chamber must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage from the acid sprayed onto them (half as much damage on a successful saving throw). The real danger from the acid is not to the characters' skin, however, but to their lungs. Everyone must also succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take an extra 2d8 acid damage. Players who declare immediately that their characters are covering their faces and getting out of the chamber as quickly as possible, and are trying to not inhale the vapor, have advantage on their Constitution saving throws.

## Treasure

The chest contains a few of the choicest items seized during the cult's recent treasure raids. Mondath persuaded [Rezmir](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rezmir_hotdq) to let her keep them, and she promised to bring them with her when she travels north for the ceremony at the Well of Dragons. In truth, she wanted something to fall back on if everything went sour (she never mentioned that last part to [Rezmir](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rezmir_hotdq)). Inside are a string of pearls (300 gp), a gold-and-sapphire ring (900 gp), and a pouch containing a half-dozen masterfully cut and polished precious stones (100 gp each). The ring and the pearls were taken from Greenest and would be recognized by anyone from there, but the stones came from elsewhere and would be difficult to identify. If the items from Greenest are returned, their owners will pay a reward worth 25 percent of their value (300 gp).
