# Rewards

Award standard XP for defeated foes. This chapter includes many challenges other than fights, and characters should be rewarded for overcoming them. The awards listed below are just recommendations; adjust them as you see fit. Characters might reach 4th level by the end of this chapter, but it's not essential that they do.

-   If you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 4th level.
-   For locating and disarming traps: 100 XP per trap.
-   For offering the roper meat instead of fighting it to the death: 1,800 XP (the roper's standard XP value).
-   For each dragon egg destroyed or taken: 250 XP.

With the dragon hatchery destroyed and the cultists all gone, characters should head for Elturel and their rendezvous with [Leosin Erlanthar](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#leosin%20erlanthar_hotdq) and [Ontharr Frume](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ontharr%20frume_hotdq). They might choose to follow the wagon tracks instead. The wagons followed the course roughly laid out on the map in Mondath's chamber: west to Beregost, then north along the Trade Way. They have at least a full day's head start on the characters, and possibly more, depending on how much time characters spent in Greenest before returning to the plateau.
