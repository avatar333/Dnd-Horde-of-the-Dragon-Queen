# Dragon Hatchery

The only thing of interest remaining in the camp is the cave itself (area 4 on the map of the camp), which characters can see from the camp. There, characters find the cultists who stayed behind, a clutch of dragon eggs, the special cadre of kobolds who tend the eggs—and the many traps the kobolds set to defend their home. These eggs are important to the cult, but they were deemed too near to hatching to be moved safely. [Rezmir](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rezmir_hotdq) left them with what she believed was an adequate guard force under [Frulam Mondath](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#frulam%20mondath_hotdq) and [Langdedrosa Cyanwrath](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#langdedrosa%20cyanwrath_hotdq).

# General Features

##### Ceilings. 

Cavern ceilings are 15 feet high. Ceilings in the humans' chambers ([areas 11](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,11.%20frulam%20mondath's%20chamber,0), [12](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,12.%20guard%20barracks,0), and [13](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,13.%20treasure%20storage,0)) are 10 feet high.

##### Light. 

During daytime, areas [1](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,1.%20cave%20entrance,0) and [2](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,2.%20concealed%20passage,0) are brightly lit, and areas [3](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,3.%20fungus%20garden,0) and [4](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,4.%20stirge%20lair,0) are dimly lit by outside light. All other areas are in darkness unless the area notes otherwise.

##### Sound. 

The caverns are filled with faint sounds: dripping water, scratching rodents, scrabbling lizards, wind moaning across the entrance. These normal underground sounds camouflage the clanks, thuds, coughs, and speech of the kobolds and cultists. Sound echoes well along the main chamber (areas 1–5), so a fight in any of these can be heard in the others. Elsewhere, normal sounds echo confusingly and are lost in the background noise. The sound of a scream carries a long distance, however, and the sound of a fight travels through 30 feet of tunnel and attracts attention if the fight lasts more than 3 rounds.

# Wandering Monsters

Kobolds move freely through the caverns, going about their business. Characters have a chance to randomly encounter these wandering kobolds. Roll a d6 every time characters enter or re-enter [areas 3](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,3.%20fungus%20garden,0) to [10](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#hotdq,3,10.%20dragon%20hatchery,0). On a roll of 1, monsters are present. Roll on the table to determine what they meet. These randomly encountered monsters are added to any creatures mentioned in the area description. Be sure to make this roll before characters enter the area, because both groups have a chance to gain surprise.
