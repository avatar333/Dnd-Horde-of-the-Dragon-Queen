If the characters learn of the camp location and probable site of the rearguard from the stragglers, they can use that information to bypass this encounter entirely. in fact, that would be the smart thing to do, both because it negates a damaging fight and because if the rearguard is wiped out, leaders in the cult will wonder why it never reported back. the best result for the characters is if the outpost checks in at the correct time with an "all clear."

the rearguard consists of one [[Monster.Veteran]], six [[Monster.Cultist]] and two [[Monster.Acolyte]] the guard and cultists have spears for both ranged and melee combat. they are positioned in an area where the trail winds through a gap between two outcrops. the ambushers are hidden in the rocks, 12 to 15 feet above ground level. characters might detect the ambush, with the odds depending on what they know and how they approach the area.

-   if stragglers described the likely ambush spot to characters, it can be recognized from 200 yards away with a successful dc 10 wisdom (perception) check.
-   if stragglers mentioned the rearguard but didn't describe the spot, it is recognized as a good spot for an ambush from 100 yards away with a successful dc 15 wisdom (perception) check.
-   if characters haven't been warned about the rearguard, someone spots a face peering down from above with a successful dc 20 wisdom (perception) check, but not until the characters are within 20 yards.
-   if players state that they're watching for potential ambush spots, give them advantage when making these checks.

the rearguard has a twofold mission. it must stop any small party of intruders coming up the trail, or harass and delay a larger group while sending word to the camp that trouble approaches. the veteran decides that he has enough of an advantage against a party of five or six adventurers to deal with the problem on the spot, provided he doesn't weaken his force by sending a runner to [[NPC.Frulam Mondath|NPC  - Frulam_Mondath]]. If the adventuring group contains seven or more characters, you can either have the veteran harass the enemy and dispatch a runner to the camp, or you can add cultists until they outnumber the characters by two or three, then let the cultists make a stand.

If characters walk into the trap, the cultists tumble boulders onto them. Each character must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d12 bludgeoning damage from falling rocks (half as much damage on a successful save). The boulder attack constitutes the cultists' surprise round. After that, they use ranged attacks until they are out of ammunition or the heroes force them into melee. Because they are positioned in the rocks above the characters, the cultists have three-quarters cover against attacks from below (+5 bonus to AC). To reach the foes, characters must scramble up the rocks. The distance is only 10 to 15 feet and no ability check is required, but the rocks are difficult terrain.

##### Developments

These raiders are distinctly different from the earlier stragglers. All are dressed in similar (but not identical) black leather tunics with flared, black mantles. These are dedicated cultists. If captured, nothing less than a successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check can pry any information from them. Even with that, all they reveal is that they are initiates in the Cult of the Dragon, the names of their leaders ([Rezmir](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rezmir_hotdq), [Frulam Mondath](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#frulam%20mondath_hotdq), and [Langdedrosa Cyanwrath](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#langdedrosa%20cyanwrath_hotdq)), and that the raid on Greenest was to collect treasure for dragons. [Rezmir](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#rezmir_hotdq) outranks the other leaders.

##### Rewards

Award standard XP for defeated foes. The cultists have no treasure, but their Cult of the Dragon outfits and weapons could be invaluable when characters try to get into the raiders' camp.
