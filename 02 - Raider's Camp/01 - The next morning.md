In the warm light of day, Governor Nighthill and attack on Greenest, and why the town was a target. other leaders want to know who was behind the

The raiders retreated toward the southeast, and their  
trail is easy to spot. A small, stealthy group could follow  
the trail to the raiders’ camp and gather information.  

Governor Nighthill approaches the characters with  
a proposal: If they locate the raiders’ camp and find  
out certain information, he offers to pay them 250 gp  
apiece. He wants to know where the camp is sited, how  
many raiders are there, who their leaders are, what’s  
motivating these attacks, and where they plan to strike  
next. If characters recover valuables that were stolen  
from the town, he would like them returned, but he does  
his best to arrange a reward from what’s left of the town  
treasury. Recovering treasure, however, is a lesser goal  
when compared to the other objectives he brings up.  

Any gear or supplies the characters need for the trip  
are furnished by the town. As characters prepare to set  
off on this mission (or to leave town if they turn down  
the mission), though, an injured monk approaches.

```ad-readout
title: Read out aloud -    The monk’s name is Nesim Waladra.
A young man walks up to you, limping heavily on his
bandaged left leg. “ I hear that you intend to follow the
raiders and see where they’ve gone. I’d like nothing better
than to come with you, but in this condition, I’d slow you
down. In the midst of all this tragedy, there's no reason
you would have heard about the fate of my master, Leosin
Erlanthar, but it’s important you know. He is a monk from
Berdusk. He disappeared last night, after we fought a
particularly savage battle against raiders. A few others and
I fought our way to the keep, barely. Leosin didn’t make it
at all. We went back this morning to look for him, but all
we found was his broken staff and this choker, which he
always wore."

“ Leosin has been investigating these raiders for months. I
fear that he might have tried to infiltrate their group when
they retreated, or worse, was captured and carried away
as a prisoner. No one understands these bandits better
than he does, and his knowledge will be invaluable against
them. When you find their camp, please look for any
sign that Leosin is there. One of my brothers has already
departed for Berdusk to bring back help, but it will be
many days before help arrives. Anything you can do before
then would be a godsend.”
```
Nesim answers the characters’ questions to the best
of his ability, but he also urges them to move quickly.
The monks were returning to Berdusk from the great
library at Candlekeep, where Leosin was consulting the
librarians and researching ancient writings on dragon
folklore. Dragon cults are his special interest.
The broken staff is nothing special. The choker is a
braided leather neckband with a silver dragon design
chased into the leather. The ends are ragged, as if it was
roughly torn off.

**Tracking the Raiders**
The raiders’ path is easy to follow across the rolling
grassland of the Greenfields. A wide swath of grass is
trampled down, but it’s impossible to determine the
raiders’ numbers precisely. The path only confirms
what characters already know: there were a lot of them,
and they were a mix of humans, kobolds, and trained
reptiles. One bit of information can be gleaned with a
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check: Many of
the beasts’ footprints are deeper on the retreat than they
were on the approach march. They were weighed down
with loot on the homeward-bound trip, but let players
reach that conclusion on their own. It’s not possible to
tell from the confusing jumble of prints whether any specific footprints are those of prisoners
