##### Wandering Encounters  
The streets of Greenest are overrun by forces consisting  
of cultists and acolytes accompanied by monstrous  
allies: kobolds with ambush drakes (see appendix B)  
and giant lizards. These raiders move through town  
without fear, pillaging as they go. As characters travel  
through the embattled village, they can run into raiders  
and townsfolk. Use these guidelines to determine if  
characters have an encounter.

If characters use cover and stealth to avoid encounters, have each character attempt a DC 10 Dexterity  
(Stealth) check. For every two individual checks that  
fail, the characters have one encounter on the way to  
their destination. Roll a d8 on the Episode 1 Encounters  
table to determine each encounter. If characters use the  
stream bed for cover for most of the trip, these characters have advantage on their Dexterity checks.  
If characters don’t use cover and stealth to avoid  
encounters, roll a d8 for every 100 feet they move in  
town. If the roll is 4 or lower, they didn’t attract attention with that move. If the roll is 5 or higher, they run  
into something; roll a d8 again and check the Episode 1  
Encounters table to see what the characters meet.

*Without warning, five humans dash out from between two  
buildings on your left. A limping man and three young  
children race across the street into more shadows, and a  
woman carrying a round shield and a broken spear turns  
and faces back in the direction from which they came.  
Eight [[Monster - Kobold]]'s stream out of the alley on the family’s heels  
and fan out around the woman, who looks determined to  
delay the creatures for as long as possible*

collapse: closed

The woman is Linan Swift, and her husband is Cuth.  
Linan is a commoner but with 8 hit points. Her attack  
with the spear is +2 to hit for 1d6 piercing damage. Her  
husband is down to 2 hit points from an earlier fight.  
The children move at speed 20. They can be carried, but  
a character carrying a child has disadvantage on attack  
rolls and cannot wield a two-handed weapon
