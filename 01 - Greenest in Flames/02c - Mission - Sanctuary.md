**PLAY** [[https://crowds.ambient-mixer.com/rpgs---fantasy]] / Crowd riot with battle and creature sounds

```ad-readout
   Dozens of townsfolk have barricaded themselves inside  
the temple to Chauntea, but raiders have it surrounded.  
The attackers tried setting fire to the stout structure but  
had little success. Now they’ve deployed an improvised  
battering ram. It’s only a matter of time, possibly minutes, before the temple’s main doors crumple under the  
assault, leaving the villagers inside helpless.  
The temple is a large building, made of fieldstone with  
a peaked slate roof, and square in shape. It is taller than  
most other buildings in town. Inside, the altar occupies  
the middle of the temple, with other worship areas  
arranged around it.

**Foes.** The force outside the temple is split into three  
groups. One (A) is battering at the front doors, another  
(B) is circling the temple in a screeching mob, and the  
third (C) is heaping burning straw against a rear door.  
All these groups together would overwhelm 1st-level  
characters, but characters can devise a plan that gets  
them inside the temple by dealing with one group.  

**Group A** consists of one dragonclaw (see appendix B),  
two cultists, and six kobolds. The cultists are handling  
the ram while the kobolds stand guard in case the town  
militia mounts a counterattack. The dragonclaw is in  
charge. The kobold guards are alert, but they are distracted when Group B passes in front of the temple

   **Group B** consists of three cultists, ten kobolds, and  
two ambush drakes (see appendix B) strung out in a  
mob that stretches 50 feet. This procession with leaping  
and whirling kobolds completes one circuit around the  
temple approximately every eight minutes (two minutes  
per side).  

**Group C** consists of two cultists and six kobolds  
clustered tightly around the temple’s back door. Their  
meager fire produces little flame, instead creating prodigious clouds of thick smoke that engulf the back of the  
temple and blanket the surrounding 30 feet of ground.  
Everything in the smoke is lightly obscured, and objects  
or creatures that are seen through more than 15 feet of  
smoke are heavily obscured. Characters can sneak up on  
these raiders and gain a surprise round against them, as  
long as they avoid Group B in the process.  

**Arranging a Rescue.** 
The heroes’ best shot at rescuing the townsfolk is to overpower Group C and take  
control of the back door. In the temple, they can arrange  
a distraction to keep Groups A and B occupied at the  
front while the citizens of Greenest slip out the back  
and race for the keep or for the old tunnel—if characters  
have opened it already. That’s only one possibility; clever  
players can come up with different solutions.  
The townsfolk in the temple are near panic, however,  
and they won’t take orders from strangers unless someone makes a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion)  
check. Otherwise, characters need to locate the priest of  
Chauntea, Eadyan Falconmoon, a level-headed half-elf.  
He’s easy to spot, being the only calm person they can  
find in the temple, and he is elated to see them. He looks  
to the characters for a plan.  

Time is pressing. While characters are inside the  
temple, remind them of the booming hammer blows  
of the battering ram against the front doors, the cracking timbers, the stones and sputtering torches that fly  
through the windows intermittently, the smoke rolling  
below the ceiling, and the frightened townsfolk. How  
much time you allow before the doors burst open  
depends on your group; slow thinkers and careful plotters need more time than fast movers. What’s important  
is that players feel pressed.  

To create a sense of pressure, give the front doors  
30 hit points and let each thud of the battering ram  
deal 1d6 damage. When the doors reach 20 hit points,  
they have cracks large enough to see through. At 10 hit  
points, the doors are sagging in their hinges. At 5, they  
could collapse at the next impact. How frequently you  
roll the die is up to you! One roll every 15-20 seconds  
is a good target for an average group. One roll every 30  
seconds might be better for a group that needs to debate  
and reach consensus, while a group containing quickon-their-feet, take-charge types could deal with a roll  
every 10 seconds. Be flexible, keep an eye on the players’ level of tension, and don’t let anyone relax.  

If the doors burst open before the temple is evacuated,  
this scene turns into an ugly melee against Group A. The  
kobolds in that group prefer to attack unarmed villagers  
instead of lethal adventurers. Each kobold automatically  
kills one villager each round unless characters attack the  
kobolds, cut them off from their victims, or interfere some 
other way. If townsfolk have already evacuated the temple
   through the back door, or that process is well along  
before the front doors split apart under the ram, then  
characters can conduct a fighting withdrawal through the  
temple. After everyone gets into the smoke outside, they  
can close and brace the back door, then sprint for the  
keep or the tunnel in the stream bank with enough of a  
head start to get away safely.  

**Rewards.** Rescuing people from the temple earns  
each character 100 XP in addition to the points for killing monsters. If more than ten villagers died during the  
rescue, reduce that award to 50 XP.
