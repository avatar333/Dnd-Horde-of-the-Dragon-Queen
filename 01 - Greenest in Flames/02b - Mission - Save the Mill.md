   From the parapet of the keep, someone spots a group  
of raiders trying to set fire to the town mill. Governor  
Nighthill quickly approaches the adventurers.  
```

```ad-readout
“The guards have spotted a new threat. Raiders are trying  
to set fire to the town’s mill. If it burns, we’ll lose our  
stockpile of flour and we won’t be able to grind more for  
months. I’m trying to assemble enough defenders from  
here in the keep to defend it through the rest of the night,  
but that will take time. You’d do us a great service if you  
could get to the mill quickly and drive away the raiders  
before they can set it aflame. You’ll need to defend it until  
our force arrives to take over, but it shouldn’t be more than  
fifteen minutes behind you.”

   The mill is about 500 feet from the keep. The distance  
is doubled if characters use the secret tunnel and follow  
the stream to stay hidden.  

Roll a d6 on the Episode 1 Encounters table to determine the strength of the raiders that are trying to set fire  
to the mill. Any kobolds in this force run away as soon  
as two or more raiders are killed. 

If characters observe  the mill for a minute or more before attacking, allow  
them to attempt DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) or Charisma  
(Performance) checks. If successful, a character realizes  
that the raiders are making a demonstration of starting  
a fire, but it’s for show. A few fires are burning around  
the building, but they could be extinguished easily.  
This act of burning the mill is a ruse. 

Mondath has been informed that heroes are aiding the town, and she  
wants to lure them into an ambush. More raiders—one
cultist plus one guard per character—are hiding inside  
the mill, waiting for the characters to show up.  

The mill is a simple rectangular barn, about 40 feet  
long and 20 feet wide, with an attached, exterior office.  
The long side of the building away from the stream has  
barn doors and a two-part door, and the two short walls  
have windows. All these openings are closed, but none  
are locked or barred. 

Inside, the main floor is dominated  
by a massive stone grinding wheel driven by a water  
wheel in the stream. The mill was operating late when  
the raid began and the millers fled without disengaging  
the wheel, so it still turns noisily. 

The upper half of the  barn is a loft where milled flour is stored. The loft can  
be reached by wooden stairs along the east wall or by  
using the ropes and pulleys that hoist bags of flour up  
and down through large openings in the loft floor.  
The ambushers are waiting in the loft for heroes to  
enter the mill. When the heroes are inside, the guards  
launch a volley of spears from above, then leap down to  
fight hand-to-hand. The ambushers have a good chance  
to gain a surprise round for their spear volley; a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed  
to notice them before the attack. Characters who scan  
the loft for hidden enemies upon entering the mill have  
advantage on the check.  
Ten minutes after the second fight ends, a dozen  
bloody but basically healthy defenders arrive from the  
keep with orders to relieve the characters and defend  
the mill. They tell the characters to go back to the keep  
quietly while they remain behind at the mill.  

**Rewards**. Award standard XP for defeated foes. If  
characters realized they were walking into a trap, give  
each a 50 XP bonus. If they didn’t deduce that it was a  
trap but spotted the ambushers in time to prevent a surprise round, give each character a 25 XP bonus.
