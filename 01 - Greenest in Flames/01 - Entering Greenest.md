```ad-readout

*For the past several days, you have been traveling a road  
that winds lazily across the rolling grasslands of the  
Greenfields. The main bridge that spanned the Kolgan river
forced you to take a detour south and travel through the
Megrim Woods, but was otherwise uneventful. You emerge from 
the woods as sundown is approaching when you top a  
rise and see the town of Greenest just a few short miles  
away. But instead of the pleasant, welcoming town you  
expected, you see columns of black smoke rising from  
burning buildings, running figures that are little more than  
dots at this distance, and a dark, winged shape wheeling  
low over the keep that rises above the center of the town.  
Greenest is being attacked by a dragon!*

* The PCs are about 500m away from the town, they can get there in about 2-3mins (sprint)
* After entering the town, the party will very quickly be thrown into [[02 - Seek the Keep]]
* They need to get the NPC's they encounter to the Keep ASAP, after which they will speak with [[NPC.Governor Nighthill]], who will have with him [[NPC.Castellan Escobert the Red]]

##### General Features  
The sun has set by the time characters reach the edge of town (the area shown on the Greenest map). Light. Burning buildings and a half moon provide dim light throughout the town. The inside of the keep is brightly illuminated. 

##### Fires. 
The cultists tried to set buildings ablaze as they moved through town, but thatch isnâ€™t as flammable as it looks. When characters arrive, most of the flames come from haystacks and barns, not from homes or shops. 

##### The Stream. 
The stream that flows past Greenest is shallow (seldom more than 3 feet deep) with a gravel bottom, so characters can move along it without difficulty. Where the banks are clear, the stream is easy to get into or out of. Brush by the stream is dense, and the banks are steep where brush grows. Characters can move only 5 feet per turn through the brush
