   Governor Nighthill would like to interrogate some of the  
raiders.


```ad-readout
   “ I’d give anything to know what we’re up against, and why.  
For that, we need prisoners. A commander, even a lowranking one, is best.”
```

   If the characters haven’t run into any cult leaders yet,  
Nighthill takes them onto the parapet and points out  
what he means. This is an ideal time for everyone to  
catch a glimpse of Frulam Mondath (see appendix B)  
in her purple robes, accompanied by a dozen guards.  
Even the governor cautions characters against attacking such a formidable force, especially when any  
lower-level officer can answer his questions.  
Leaving the keep through the front gate is out of the  
question. By now, too many raiders are watching it, and  
they would jump the characters as soon as they moved  
away from the keep. Other options are waiting for a  
cloud to cover the moon before climbing down ropes  
tossed over the back wall of the keep, or using the old  
tunnel that exits into the stream bed.  
This mission can be combined with another mission,  
such as saving the mill or rescuing villagers from the  
temple of Chauntea. All characters need to do is bring  
a live cultist or Cult of the Dragon initiate back to the  
keep. Or characters can go into the town hunting for one  
specifically.  
Prisoners brought back to the keep are interrogated  
by Governor Nighthill and a few of his picked guards.  
Characters can participate if they want to.

   • Captured kobolds are terrified; they say whatever they  
think the questioner wants to hear. They know that
   they’re working for the Cult of the Dragon and for the  
“dragon lady” (Rezmir), and that they’re after loot.  
• Captured mercenaries or bandits talk freely; they  
have no special loyalty to the Cult of the Dragon. They  
reveal that they’ve been raiding communities around  
the Greenfields for loot, and they’ve heard rumors in  
the camp about dragon eggs.  
• Cultists and initiates are the most tight-lipped. A  
successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) or DC  
12 Charisma (Persuasion) check is needed to cause  
cultists to reveal that they are members of the Cult of  
the Dragon and that they are collecting loot “for the  
great hoard that will usher in the reign of the Queen  
of Dragons.” They know that the cult has a clutch of  
dragon eggs under heavy guard in a cave at the camp.  

**Rewards.** If characters capture a prisoner, award  
each of them 25 XP. To collect that award, the prisoner  
must be brought to the governor. Interrogating the  
prisoner independently and bringing the information to  
the governor doesn’t count. The characters also receive  
standard XP for any monsters they defeat along the way.
