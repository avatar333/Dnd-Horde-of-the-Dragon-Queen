<br>

 A narrow tunnel runs from the cellar beneath the keep to the bank of the stream (area 2). The tunnel is wide enough to allow warriors to pass through it in single file. In the keep, the tunnel is sealed with a locked ironbound door, and the stream exit is covered with a locked iron grate made to look like a sewer outlet. The tunnel’s main function was as a secret means of collecting water from the stream during a siege, but it can double as a sally port. Since the keep has never been besieged, the old tunnel has never been used. Barrels and crates are piled in front of the door. The keys for the locks are on the ring that [[NPC.Castellan Escobert the Red]] carries with him everywhere. 
 
 At some point, [[NPC.Castellan Escobert the Red]] recommends the tunnel as a means of sneaking townsfolk into the keep without running the gauntlet of attackers watching the gates. 
 
 **Locks**. 
 Characters can clear the cellar door with a few minutes’ work. The lock is stiff but opens with the key; without the key, the character can open the lock with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check and a set of thieves’ tools. The disused tunnel is choked with webs but is otherwise clear. A few yards inside the stream end is a nest of two [[Monster - Swarms of rats]]. The rats attack when disturbed, and the surviving rats flee when half their number die. 
 
 Years of exposure and neglect have corroded the lock on the exit grate. Even with the key, a successful DC 10 Dexterity check is needed to open the lock. Without the key, the DC increases to 20. If the roll misses by 5 or more, the key or thieves’ tools break off in the lock so that unlocking it becomes impossible. Then only a successful DC 15 Strength check can force the grate open. 
 
 **Foes**. 
 A group of cultists is searching the stream banks for hiding townsfolk when the characters emerge from the tunnel. If characters open the lock with the key or with thieves’ tools, the first one to exit notices the raiders approaching without being spotted in return; the characters can keep out of sight in the tunnel or try to ambush the raiders after they pass. If the check fails, the raiders spot the character; roll initiative and proceed with combat. If the grate had to be broken open with a Strength check, the raiders hear the noise and find cover; they wait for the characters to exit the tunnel, then gain a surprise round. The raiders’ group consists of two cultists and six kobolds. If any cultists are still alive at the beginning of the fourth round of the fight, one of them runs to fetch help. Ten minutes later, two cultists, ten kobolds, and one ambush drake (see appendix B) arrive to guard the tunnel.
